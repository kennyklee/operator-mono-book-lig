# Operator Mono Ligatures - 'Book' weight

This is a forked project from [https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig).

All credit goes there! ^

I just changed all references from 'Medium' to 'Book' and viola...it worked!

I like it much better than the 'Medium' font weight.
